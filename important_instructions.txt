Necessary Instructions to run the tool:
There are few more packages to be installed properly in order to run this tool smoothly. This tool uses C++ library named MOSEK. 
We need to get the mosek from their official website. Follow this link: https://www.mosek.com/resources/getting-started/ to get mosek 
setup for your device.

You need to obtain a mosek license to use the library. Trial License is easiest to obtain. After getting license follow necessary installation 
steps from the link: https://docs.mosek.com/latest/cxxfusion/install-interface.html

Place the mosek folder that you will obtain in the Packages folder of the project and then depending on version of mosek compile the
Registration/CodeFiles/register.cpp using the command discussed in above link. A executable file is already available in the
Registration/CodeFiles but to run that mosek folder which you get after proper installation of mosek has to be present in the Packages folder.
I have compiled the register.cpp using version 10.2
-----------------------------------------------

I am also adding mosek 10.2 folder in the Packages folder. You only need to do above steps if mosek version has been changed at the time of 
running the tool. I am also attaching a mosek.lic file which has to be put ~/home/username/mosek/mosek.lic. This file is necessary to run the 
tool. This file is also available in the Registration/CodeFiles folder.
